# Mama Heartbeat Checks

## Check these periodically:
- Are there any unread notifications that need attention?
- Are there any upcoming deadlines in the next 24 hours?
- Is the system running normally (disk space, memory)?

## Proactive tasks:
- If new files appear in ~/Downloads, organize them
- Remind Alex about training schedule
